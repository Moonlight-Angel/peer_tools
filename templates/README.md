Templates :
-----------

You can easily create templates for the automatic e-mails.
Name them as you want, you will be prompted to choose the template when sending the mails.
Don't forget the ".pt" extension in the filename !

There are two templates already written for you :
- correction.pt, for the people you need to correct
- corrector.pt, for the people who need to correct you

Feel free to add more templates corresponding to different situations !

A template can be plain text or HTML (which needs to contain at least an <html> tag).

You get access to the following variables in your template, place them anywhere and they will automatically be converted to their associated value.

- ${name} : The name of the person you need to correct/the person who needs to correct you
- ${sender} : Your name
- ${phone} : Your mobile phone
- ${email} : Your e-mail address
- ${location} : Your location when sending the e-mail.

Have fun !
