The second version of Peer Tools (29/01/14) was rewritten from scratch.
Error handling has been improved. They are clearer and most error cases are now supported.
Multiple projects handling has been added (either for git clones or phone numbers searching).
Curl is now used instead of wget, which increases compatibility.
The source code is clearer and each function is commented for better maintainability.
